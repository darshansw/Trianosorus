    <h1>Tyrannosaurus</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Tyrannosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The species
      Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often called T. rex or
      colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods.
      Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what
      was then an island continent known as Laramidia.

    <h2>Skeleton Discovery</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning in the 1960s, there was renewed interest in Tyrannosaurus,
      resulting in the recovery of 42 skeletons (5â€“80% complete by bone count)
      from Western North America. In 1967, Dr. William MacMannis located and
      recovered the skeleton named "MOR 008", which is 15% complete by bone
      count and has a reconstructed skull displayed at the Museum of the
      Rockies.
